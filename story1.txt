Once upon a time in gwallameji, there was aboy called bosco. He was a student of Agric Mechanization.

In first semester, he used to play and go to parties at bubies and New trafford.

Then first semester exams happened, and his eyes became RED!

When result came out, he was having a nightmare while awake because out of 10 courses, he had 10 carryovers and his GP became 0.00.
